# HockeyStats

This is the repository for the code used to perform the analysis of the Hockey stats about players, goalies and games.

The Data set was obtained from Kaggle's user [Martin Ellis](https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis).

# Motivation

The main motivation of this project was the Udacity nano degree I am doing (Dat Scientist) and my passion and love for ice hockey.

I played hockey back in South America in the 80's in roller blades and always dreamed to play ice hockey. It never happened. But I watch every game every day!

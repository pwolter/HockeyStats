# HockeyStats

This is the repository for the code used to perform the analysis of the Hockey stats about players, goalies and games.

# Motivation

The main motivation of this project was the Udacity nano degree I am doing (Data Scientist) and my passion and love for ice hockey.

I played hockey back in South America in roller blades. I have always dreamed about playing ice hockey. It never happened. But I watch every game, every day!

# File descriptions

I have used the following files:

- **team_info.csv** Team information
- **player_info.csv** Player information
- **game_skater_stats.csv** Player stats, goals, shots, penalty minutes, etc.
- **game_goalie_stats.csv** Goalie stats, save percentage, saves, etc.
- **game.csv** Game stats, season, away/hoem goals, etc.

# Credits

The Data set was obtained from Kaggle's user [Martin Ellis](https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis). Thanks a ton Martin!! It is super hard to find such quality data for the NHL.

I use a lot functions and techniques I have learned (and borrowed) from Jeremy Howard from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/). I cannot thank Jeremy enough for all his work and courses.
